Question :- The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
1.	"123"
2.	"132"
3.	"213"
4.	"231"
5.	"312"
6.	"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
Note:
•	Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
•	Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
Answer :- 
def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        
        nums = [str(i) for i in range(1,n+1)]
        result= []
        index = k-1
        factorial = math.factorial(n)
        while len(nums):
            factorial = factorial // len(nums)
            pos = index // factorial
            result.append(nums.pop(pos))
            index = index % factorial
        return "".join(result)
