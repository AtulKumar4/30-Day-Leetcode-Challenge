Question :- Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Answer :- ## change position of 0 and 2 then 1 will automaticcaly will get adjusted to its position
def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        current = 0
        
        while current  <= r:
            if nums[current] == 0:
                nums[l],nums[current] = nums[current], nums[l]
                l += 1
                current +=1
            elif nums[current] == 2:
                nums[current],nums[r] = nums[r],nums[current]
                r -= 1
            else:
                current += 1
