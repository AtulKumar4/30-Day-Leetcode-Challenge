Question :- You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

Answer :- 
def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        
        ways = [0] * (amount+1)
        ways[0] = 1
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(1,amount+1):
                if coin <= i:
                    ways[i] += + ways[i-coin]
        return ways[-1]
