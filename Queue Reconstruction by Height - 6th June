Question :-  Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Answer :-
def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        sortedlist = sorted(people, key = lambda x: (-x[0],x[1]))
        
        result = []
        
        for i in sortedlist:
            result.insert(i[1],i)
            
        return result
